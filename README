In general: 
 * Solution programs read the input from the file `input.txt` and prints the solutions to both parts on two separate lines.
 * There is no build system. Compilation is usually a simple compiler invocation (where applicable).

Exceptions to these rules are mentioned in a puzzle-specific README file.
